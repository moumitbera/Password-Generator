# Password Generator
This program generates a random and strong password. 

## Definition of Strong password
Generally a strong password is a randomly generated password from 10 to 32 places.
Each place being occupied with either alphabets or digits or symbols.
But one of each kind is mendatory.
However here I have capped the max length to 24, for better user ex.
And we will have a minimum of 2 letters, 2 digits and 2 symbols in any case.

## Output of this code
The program has specified the max and min length of password. Once we confirm, each time the generator shall
generate new password randomly, with random number of alphabets, digits and symbols, and with random length.
